    lineText: "Jordan\u2019s under pressure to hit deadlines, but that\u2019s no
      excuse for snapping. I try not to take it personally\u2026 though sometimes
      I wonder if he\u2019s just embarrassed to admit he needs help."

    topic: Project Phoenix
    lineText: "I get uncomfortable, too. We told ourselves it was for \u2018better
      insights,\u2019 but collecting so much data\u2026 it doesn\u2019t feel ethical.
      I kept pushing to anonymize it, but my concerns got lost in the shuffle."

    topic: Data access
    lineText: "Honestly, I wanted to double-check that nobody\u2019s sensitive info
      was exposed. I\u2019ve seen leaks before; my gut was telling me we needed an
      extra look at the logs."

    topic: Jordan behavior
    lineText: "He meant that as a joke, well, a terrible joke. He thinks I\u2019m
      overstepping by asking too many questions. I guess he\u2019s worried I\u2019ll
      find something he doesn\u2019t want anyone to see."

    topic: Project Phoenix
    lineText: "We started pulling location histories, contact networks\u2026 stuff
      people never signed off on sharing. It seemed harmless at first, but now I
      see how invasive it really got."

    lineText: "He\u2019s got an old-school view: control from the top. I call him
      out sometimes, but he digs in his heels. It\u2019s part of why I worry he\u2019d
      rather sweep uncomfortable truths under the rug."

    topic: Project Phoenix
    lineText: "Good question. After budget cuts, it wasn\u2019t about insights, it
      was covering up mistakes. We needed more leverage over clients, so we made
      the data bigger, not better."

    topic: Data access
    lineText: "No, I swear I just wanted transparency. But when I saw some folders
      mysteriously disappear, I thought someone was deleting evidence\u2026 so I
      pushed for broad access to catch them."
